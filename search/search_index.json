Definitions Folder = a folder on your computer for organizing files; File = an excel file in .xlsx or .csv format; Sheet = a sheet within an excel file; Training database = the database used to train the AI; Test dataset = the inquiry dataset awaiting the AI to generate structural hypothesis Submitting structures to the Moliverse library Thank you for contributing to the SMART training database (AKA the Moliverse Library). For this submission, we ask you to fill out some information in the metadata file (only one metadata file for all compounds being submitted), and a second file with the tabulated NMR data as described below (the NMR data for each compound in its own file). Connection between the two files will be by a 6 digit code number. The starting letter/number combination for your submitted compounds will be assigned by the SMART operators, and then you should increment up for each ensuing compound by a value of 1 (e.g. AAA001 is the assigned code, the next compound in your series is AAA002, and so forth). Although compound replicates need to be avoided, please don\u2019t worry as the SMART can cope with some replicates. You can continue adding more entries on the pre-existing metadata file with the already given code pattern. In the Metadata file and the NMR Tables, only the items with an orange colored background are required; the green fields are desirable and will help us with developing more accurate and informative future versions of SMART. If for any compound, a specific data entry is not available, please leave it as blank. As noted above, in the Metadata file, only the SMILES entry is mandatory. Only when the isomeric SMILES is not available for a compound, canonical SMILES can be entered instead. The SMILES can be found on the PubChem website for majority of published compounds. If you cannot fine the SMILES on PubChem, the 3D structure in ChemDraw can be converted to SMILES by the program. Convert Structure to SMILES To convert a ChemDraw structure to SMILES, you must: 1) Select the structure using the selection tool; 2) From the Edit menu, point to Copy As, and then choose SMILES; 3) Paste the string in the target cell of the excel metadata file sheet. Minimum information for NMR tables For compiling the NMR tables, please follow the examples in \"NMR Tables\" file in this same folder as the format for your data. NOTE: proton shifts should be rounded to exactly 2 decimal digits, and 13C shifts should be rounded to exactly a single decimal digit. For the NMR tables, the atom numbering is not needed, but just be certain that the proton shift matches the carbon shift in every row of the table. In the NMR table files, wherever there are diastereotopic protons on a methylene carbon (i.e., CH2 with two distinct proton shifts), please add a separate entry for both the carbon and proton: Column A Column B Column C 13C 1H Carbon type (optional) 43.2 3.12 CH2 43.2 3.40 CH2 In the NMR table files, please put 13C shifts in Column A of the sheet and proton shifts in Column B of the sheet, as shown above. If you have any questions, please contact Chen Zhang (chz023 at-sign ucsd dot edu) or Raphael Reher (rreher at-sign ucsd dot edu) Please download data submission package here . After you complete, please email your package back to chz023 at-sign ucsd dot edu.

The current version of SMART 2.0 as of 11/25/2019 consists of 2D NMR spectra from 53,076 natural products. Before you start, please unblock any pop-up blockers in your web browser for smart.ucsd.edu website. Please checkout the server at SMART 2.0 . Input Data Formatting Please prepare your NMR peak lists of each compound using Excel or preferably notepad/wordpad and save the NMR table of each compound as a comma-separated value (.csv) file. If you are using Microsoft Excel, this can be done by click \"save as\" and then choose the two file types. Please always place 1H data in the first column and their corresponding 13C data in the second column. The first row will be left for strings \u201c1H\u201d and \u201c13C\u201d as table head. Please strictly keep 1H shifts in 2 decimals and 13C shifts in a single decimal only. You can name the .csv file with any name that your operating system accepts. 1H 13C 3.00 29.0 3.40 29.0 5.00 57.6 5.60 59.4 1.80 19.2 5.17 57.4 7.49 129.0 7.51 130.5 7.47 131.4 In the NMR table files, wherever there are diastereotopic protons on a methylene carbon (i.e., CH2 with two distinct proton shifts), please add a separate entry for both the carbon and proton: 1H 13C 3.12 43.2 3.40 43.2 After the .csv file is ready, simply upload it to the first window by drag&drop.

The Top 10 hits are ranked by similarity scores. You can download the result by clicking the \u201cdownload results\u201d icon. Visualizing your result(s) in the 3D cluster space (Moliverse) Please click the \"Embed in the Moliverse\" bar in the upper right side of the result page. Wait a while for the Embedding Projector to launch. To find your query molecule, please type \"query\" in the search bar in the upper right side of the Embedding Projector Webpage. Naturally, your query compound as well as its 100 closest analogues will light up in unique colors (decreasing cosine similarity will be displayed by purple-red-orange-yellow). To better observe the clustering effect, please click UMAP or T-SNE tabs in the lower left window. The clusters will organize themselves in real-time, clustering more similar compounds in close proximity and more dissimilar compounds apart from each other.
