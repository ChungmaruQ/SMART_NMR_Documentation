SMART is a user-friendly, AI-based dereplication and analysis tool that uses 2D NMR data to rapidly associate newly isolated NPs with their known analogues. SMART has been designed to mimic the normal path of experiential learning in that additional 2D NMR spectral inputs can be used to enrich its database and improve its performance. In short, SMART aims to become an experienced associate to natural products researchers as well as other classes of organic chemists. Frequently asked Questions Data Privacy Q: Is the data I upload to analyze publicly visible? A: Data you upload to analyze at SMART will remain private unless you explicitly make it public. The way to make your data public are to add individual annotated HSQC data to SMART database (Moliverse). See also the tab 'Contributing to SMART'. Q: Will HSQC data that I create be public by default? A: Yes, when you add your annotated HSQC data to the Moliverse it will be visible for other users when they explore 'Into the Moliverse'. In that way your compounds can gain more attention and you likely get more citations for your paper. As training a dCNN takes some time, we will include your spectrum in new releases of SMART. Analyzing Data Q: Can I select more than one file at a time for each group in molecular networking? A: Yes, you can drag&drop up to 8 CSV files in the analysis window. The analyses will run iteratively. NMR spectrometer Types (Bruker, JEOL, Varian...) Q: Does SMART support data from different NMR vendors? A: Yes, the only input you need for SMART analysis is the NMR table of 1H and 13C chemical shifts. These are vendor and processing software independent. Browser Support We officially test on the latest Chrome browser. Other browsers, e.g. Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Edge, are not officially supported but likely will not have any issues with SMART 2.0.

Definitions Folder = a folder on your computer for organizing files; File = an excel file in .xlsx or .csv format; Sheet = a sheet within an excel file; Training database = the database used to train the AI; Test dataset = the inquiry dataset awaiting the AI to generate structural hypotheses. Submitting structures to the Moliverse library Thank you for contributing to the SMART training database (AKA the Moliverse Library). For this submission, we ask you to fill out some information in the metadata file (only one metadata file for all compounds being submitted), and a second file with the tabulated NMR data as described below (the NMR data for each compound in its own file). Connection between the two files will be by a 6 digit code number. The starting letter/number combination for your submitted compounds will be assigned by the SMART operators, and then you should increment up for each ensuing compound by a value of 1 (e.g. AAA001 is the assigned code, the next compound in your series is AAA002, and so forth). Although compound replicates need to be avoided, please don\u2019t worry as the SMART can cope with some replicates. You can continue adding more entries on the pre-existing metadata file with the already given code pattern. In the Metadata file and the NMR Tables, only the items with an orange colored background are required; the green fields are desirable and will help us with developing more accurate and informative future versions of SMART. If for any compound, a specific data entry is not available, please leave it as blank. As noted above, in the Metadata file, only the SMILES entry is mandatory. Only when the isomeric SMILES is not available for a compound, canonical SMILES can be entered instead. The SMILES can be found on the PubChem website for majority of published compounds. If you cannot find the SMILES on PubChem, the 3D structure in ChemDraw can be converted to SMILES by the program. Convert Structure to SMILES To convert a ChemDraw structure to SMILES, you must: 1) Select the structure using the selection tool; 2) From the Edit menu, point to Copy As, and then choose SMILES; 3) Paste the string in the target cell of the excel metadata file sheet. Minimum information for NMR tables For compiling the NMR tables, please follow the examples in \"NMR Tables\" file in this same folder as the format for your data. NOTE: proton shifts should be rounded to exactly 2 decimal digits, and 13C shifts should be rounded to exactly a single decimal digit. For the NMR tables, the atom numbering is not needed, but just be certain that the proton shift matches the carbon shift in every row of the table. In the NMR table files, wherever there are diastereotopic protons on a methylene carbon (i.e., CH2 with two distinct proton shifts), please add a separate entry for both the carbon and proton: Column A Column B Column C 13C 1H Carbon type (optional) 43.2 3.12 CH2 43.2 3.40 CH2 In the NMR table files, please put 13C shifts in Column A of the sheet and proton shifts in Column B of the sheet, as shown above. If you have any questions, please contact Chen Zhang (chz023 at-sign ucsd dot edu) or Raphael Reher (rreher at-sign ucsd dot edu) Please download data submission package here . After you complete, please email your package back to chz023 at-sign ucsd dot edu. References, Q&A To reference the system please citing the papers listed below.

You are ready to use SMART 2.0 Analysis! :) Please feel free to play around with the processing parameters such as including/excluding noise signals or signals from other minor compounds in case of mixtures or explore the differences of SMART results when referencing your spectra compared to tables without referencing. Overall SMART is designed to be very robust towards any of these changes as its training is not only based on the absolute position of the peaks, but the relative position of each peak towards every other peak (see also References 1 + 2). User's Guide for SMART 2.0 Analysis Welcome to use the SMART 2.0 to test your compound(s) @ SMART 2.0 . The current version of SMART 2.0 as of 11/25/2019 consists of 2D NMR spectra from 53,076 natural products. Before you start, please unblock any pop-up blockers in your web browser for smart.ucsd.edu website. One SMART 2.0 analysis should take < 20 seconds (if still 'analyzing' double check your input). You can run multiple (up to 10) analyses at once. If your results are dissatisfying please try to process your data again manually (go back to How to process a raw HSQC spectrum to a NMR table and then delete noise and duplicate annotations, add peaks missed by auto-peak picking etc.) Input Data Formatting Please prepare your NMR peak lists of each compound using Excel or preferably notepad/wordpad and save the NMR table of each compound as a comma-separated value (.csv) file. If you are using Microsoft Excel, this can be done by click \"save as\" and then choose the two file types. Please always place 1H data in the first column and their corresponding 13C data in the second column. The first row will be left for strings \u201c1H\u201d and \u201c13C\u201d as table head. Please strictly keep 1H shifts in 2 decimals and 13C shifts in a single decimal only. You can name the .csv file with any name that your operating system accepts. 1H 13C 3.00 29.0 3.40 29.0 5.00 57.6 5.60 59.4 1.80 19.2 5.17 57.4 7.49 129.0 7.51 130.5 7.47 131.4 In the NMR table files, wherever there are diastereotopic protons on a methylene carbon (i.e., CH2 with two distinct proton shifts), please add a separate entry for both the carbon and proton: 1H 13C 3.12 43.2 3.40 43.2 Supported Formats at SMART SMART supports CSV formats for analysis. You can check your csv file by opening it with text editors such as wordpad or notepad. Your table should appear like this: 1H,13C 1.09,14.3 2.21,22.2 3.41,56.9 7.21,128.6 7.29,123.4 Submit CSV file for SMART Analysis After the .csv file is ready, simply upload it to the first window by drag&drop (analysis automatically starts) or copy and paste the table and click analyze. You can submit multiple jobs at one time. Important: You have to allow pop-ups for https://smart.ucsd.edu/classic. If your analysis is still running after 20 seconds, pop-up blockers are the most likely reason why your analysis failed. The result will show up in the next webpage as images with chemical structures, compound names, similarity scores, and molecular weights. The Top 100 hits are ranked by similarity scores. You can download the result by clicking the \u201cdownload results\u201d icon and open it with Excel. Troubleshooting Overview This section addresses some common issues with the analysis workflows at SMART. If you run into any of these common issues, hopefully this page will give you actionable steps to address them. If this page cannot help you, please refer to the forum to help answer your questions. SMART Analysis Failed Job If your analysis is still running after 20 seconds, pop-up blockers are the most likely reason why your analysis failed. You have to allow pop-ups for https://smart.ucsd.edu/classic. The file format input is incorrect. Please make sure it is a supported file format for SMART (see Input Data Formatting) Downloaded Results file cannot be opened Yes you can :) You can open the downloaded results with any text editor (Excel, Notepad, Wordpad). Just make a right-click on the file, click on 'open with' and then choose one of the former mentioned programs. Results Incorrect The SMART is still at its early stage of development. It will become more and more accurate the more spectra you contribute to the Moliverse (see Contribute to SMART). - If your results show strange suggestions and all of the have a cosine score of 1.0 you probably have switched the columns. Please be sure that your first column has proton shifts (1H) and your second column has carbon shifts (13C), where each 1H-13C pair is separated by a comma. - If your CSV file won't show exactly two decimals for 1H, or exactly a single digit for 13C, you can mannually change the last digit of the chemical shift from 0 to 1. E.g., change 7.30 to 7.31. Slight variation of the last digit won't affect your test result. Visualize your result(s) in the 3D cluster space (Moliverse) Please click the \"Embed in the Moliverse\" bar in the upper right side of the result page. Wait a while for the Embedding Projector to launch. To find your query molecule, please type \"query\" in the search bar in the upper right side of the Embedding Projector Webpage. Naturally, your query compound as well as its 100 closest analogues will light up in unique colors (decreasing cosine similarity will be displayed by purple-red-orange-yellow). To better observe the clustering effect, please click UMAP or T-SNE tabs in the lower left window. The clusters will organize themselves in real-time, clustering more similar compounds in close proximity and more dissimilar compounds apart from each other. Further you can access and enjoy the whole 'Moliverse' under https://smart.ucsd.edu/classic (click on 'Explore Moliverse') Visualize the 3D cluster space (Moliverse) with VR devices Please click Video_1 , Video_2 and Video_3 to watch the VR movie.
